Here’s an outcome-based roadmap for introducing the cyber insurance product into your end-to-end solution, QBI. This roadmap is designed around key outcomes for each stage, ensuring a smooth integration of shared APIs and micro UIs.

Phase 1: Submission Context (Outcome: Efficient Data Collection)
Objective: Enable users to efficiently submit initial cyber insurance data.
Milestones:
Define submission fields: Identify key data points required for cyber insurance submissions.
API integration: Integrate with shared APIs for seamless data intake from various sources.
Micro UI Development: Design micro UIs that make the submission process intuitive and fast.
Outcome Validation: Ensure all required submission data is captured correctly and efficiently through user testing.
Outcome: Improved accuracy and speed in gathering submission data from customers.

Phase 2: Risk Assessment (Outcome: Accurate Risk Profiling)
Objective: Surface insights on the potential cyber risks faced by the customer.
Milestones:
Develop Risk Models: Collaborate with actuarial and risk experts to define the risk assessment framework for cyber insurance.
API-Driven Risk Insights: Use shared APIs to pull data for risk profiling (e.g., company size, industry, cybersecurity posture).
Micro UI for Risk Analysis: Display risk assessment insights using micro UIs for underwriting teams.
Outcome Validation: Ensure that risk assessments align with real-world exposure data, ensuring underwriters trust the outputs.
Outcome: Clear and actionable risk profiles that lead to more accurate underwriting decisions.

Phase 3: Exposure Capture (Outcome: Comprehensive Cyber Exposure Insights)
Objective: Capture and surface detailed exposure information for each client.
Milestones:
Identify Key Exposure Variables: Determine relevant data points, such as digital assets, third-party vendor risks, and regulatory obligations.
API Integration for Exposure Data: Integrate exposure data sources via APIs (e.g., financial, cybersecurity metrics).
Micro UI for Exposure Summary: Create a micro UI that summarizes key exposure elements for easy analysis.
Outcome Validation: Ensure all critical exposure information is captured and displayed accurately for underwriting and pricing purposes.
Outcome: A comprehensive view of each client’s cyber exposure, aiding in tailored insurance offerings.

Phase 4: Coverage & Risk Capture (Outcome: Tailored Coverage Based on Risk)
Objective: Recommend and capture appropriate coverage based on risk exposure.
Milestones:
Define Coverage Options: Work with product teams to define specific coverage categories (e.g., data breach, business interruption).
API-Driven Coverage Recommendations: Use APIs to suggest coverage based on exposure data and risk assessment.
Micro UI for Coverage Selection: Develop UIs that allow users to select appropriate coverages.
Outcome Validation: Test coverage recommendations and ensure they align with risk insights and customer needs.
Outcome: Tailored coverage packages that fit individual risk profiles, leading to more personalized insurance policies.

Phase 5: Rating and Pricing (Outcome: Dynamic and Fair Pricing)
Objective: Create an accurate, dynamic rating and pricing experience for the cyber insurance product.
Milestones:
Develop Rating Engine: Build or integrate a rating engine that uses exposure, risk, and coverage data to generate pricing.
API for Pricing Data: Ensure shared APIs provide real-time data that feeds into the rating process (e.g., loss history, policy terms).
Micro UI for Pricing Simulation: Create micro UIs that allow underwriters to simulate different pricing scenarios.
Outcome Validation: Validate that the pricing model is both competitive and profitable through testing and real-world data comparison.
Outcome: Fair and accurate pricing, leading to increased customer trust and profitability.

Phase 6: Post-Launch Monitoring & Optimization (Outcome: Continuous Improvement)
Objective: Monitor performance and refine the product based on real-time feedback.
Milestones:
Set Up Analytics: Use APIs and micro UIs to monitor submission success rates, risk accuracy, and pricing alignment.
Customer Feedback Loop: Develop a feedback mechanism to capture customer and underwriter input.
Iterate on Micro UIs: Continuously improve the UIs based on user behavior and feedback.
Outcome Validation: Ensure customer satisfaction, retention, and profitability metrics are met.
Outcome: Ongoing optimization of the cyber insurance product to ensure it remains competitive and user-friendly.

This roadmap breaks down the process into clear, outcome-driven phases, ensuring each step contributes to the success of the cyber insurance product in the QBI ecosystem. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any of the phases!
